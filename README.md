PyCRDT
===

Status: WIP

This library relies on the ideas presentend in [Logoot](https://doi.org/10.1109%2FTPDS.2009.173) and [LSEQ](https://doi.org/10.1145%2F2494266.2494278).

See `examples/mqtt_gui.py` for an Etherpad-like clone realized with PyQt's `QPlainTextEdit` widget and MQTT as broadcast channel.
